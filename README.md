# qbh-assignment
This assignment contain temp code for the nest and angular as per the assignment.

To run the assignment you need to run npm install on both the front and the backend technologies.

After running the same just move to the folder pdf-generator-backend in the terminal, and then open a new terminal in the editor or whatever tool you are using the folder should be pdf-generator-frrontend.

For terminal - pdf-generator-backend just run npm run start:dev
For terminal - pdf-generator-frontend just run npm start

The port will be available on 4200 for the frontend - http://localhost:4200/
and http://localhost:3000 for the api part.

Then you will see the assignment up and running.

The dependecies I used in this project is ng2-pdf-viewer to make the view of pdf in the frontend folder.

Thanks for the opportunity this is only what I need to share. If you face any difficulties in running this project can contact me at 7891913546.
